It lets you and others work together on projects from anywhere. 2.1 Getting Started Create a GitHub account Download Git 2.2 Understanding terms &amp; Processes descriptions of GitHub and Git With a language all its own, this quick guide to common terms of GitHub and Git will have you collaborating in no time. 2.2.1 Repository A repository is the most basic element of Git and GitHub. Imagine it as a project’s folder. A repository contains all of the project files (including documentation), and stores each file’s revision history. 2.2.2 Commit An individual change to a file (or set of files). With Git, every time you save it creates a unique ID (a.k.a. the “SHA” or “hash”) that allows you to keep record of what changes were made when and by who. Commits usually contain a commit message which is a brief description the changes made. 2.2.3 Branch A parallel version of repository. It is contained within the repository, but does not affect the primary or master branch allowing you to work freely without disrupting the “live” version. 2.2.4 Remote The connection of a local repository with one on GitHub. It permits revision history to be synchronized by publishing local commits and downloading any new changes from GitHub. 2.2.5 Pull Request A feature on GitHub which provides conversation, line-by-line code review, change history analysis, and summaries of modified files. 2.3 Using GitHub 2.3.1 Step 1. Create a Repository A repository is usually used to organize a single project. Repositories can contain folders and files, images, videos, spreadsheets, and data sets – anything your project needs. We recommend including a README, or a file with information about your project. GitHub makes it easy to add one at the same time you create your new repository. It also offers other common options such as a license file. Your hello-world repository can be a place where you store ideas, resources, or even share and discuss things with others. 2.3.1.1 To create a new repository In the upper right corner, next to your avatar or identicon, click and then select New repository.
