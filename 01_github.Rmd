## Understanding terms & Processes descriptions of GitHub and Git

With a language all its own, this quick guide to common terms of GitHub and Git will have you collaborating in no time.

### Repository
A repository is the most basic element of Git and GitHub. Imagine it as a project's folder. A repository contains all of the project files (including documentation), and stores each file's revision history.

### Commit
An individual change to a file (or set of files). With Git, every time you save it creates a unique ID (a.k.a. the "SHA" or "hash") that allows you to keep record of what changes were made when and by who. Commits usually contain a commit message which is a brief description the changes made.

### Branch
A parallel version of repository. It is contained within the repository, but does not affect the primary or master branch allowing you to work freely without disrupting the "live" version.

### Remote
The connection of a local repository with one on GitHub. It permits revision history to be synchronized by publishing local commits and downloading any new changes from GitHub.

### Pull Request
A  feature on GitHub which provides conversation, line-by-line code review, change history analysis, and summaries of modified files.

## Using GitHub

### Step 1. Create a Repository

A **repository** is usually used to organize a single project. Repositories can contain folders and files, images, videos, spreadsheets, and data sets â€“ anything your project needs. We recommend including a *README*, or a file with information about your project. GitHub makes it easy to add one at the same time you create your new repository. *It also offers other common options such as a license file.*

Your `hello-world` repository can be a place where you store ideas, resources, or even share and discuss things with others.

#### To create a new repository

In the upper right corner, next to your avatar or identicon, click  and then select New repository.
Name your repository hello-world.
Write a short description.
Select Initialize this repository with a README.
