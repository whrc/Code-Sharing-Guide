# Github Tutorial

GitHub Desktop is an open source [Electron](https://electron.atom.io)-based
GitHub app. It is written in [TypeScript](http://www.typescriptlang.org) and
uses [React](https://facebook.github.io/react/).

## Where can I get it?

Download the official installer for your operating system:

 - [macOS](https://central.github.com/deployments/desktop/desktop/latest/darwin)
 - [Windows](https://central.github.com/deployments/desktop/desktop/latest/win32)
 - [Windows machine-wide install](https://central.github.com/deployments/desktop/desktop/latest/win32?format=msi)

You can install this alongside your existing GitHub Desktop for Mac or GitHub
Desktop for Windows application.

**NOTE**: there is no current migration path to import your existing
repositories into the new application - you can drag-and-drop your repositories
from disk onto the application to get started.
