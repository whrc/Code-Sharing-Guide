# Github Tutorial

GitHub is a code hosting platform for version control and collaboration. It lets you and others work together on projects from anywhere.

## Getting Started {-}

[Create a GitHub account](https://github.com/)

[Download GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/)

## Github Jargon {-}

With a language all its own, this quick guide to common terms of GitHub and Git will have you collaborating in no time.

### Repository {-}
A repository is the most basic element of Git and GitHub. Imagine it as a project's folder. A repository contains all of the project files (including documentation), and stores each file's revision history.

### Commit {-}
An individual change to a file (or set of files). With Git, every time you save it creates a unique ID (a.k.a. the "SHA" or "hash") that allows you to keep record of what changes were made when and by whom. Commits usually contain a commit message which is a brief description the changes made.

### Branch {-}
A parallel version of repository. It is contained within the repository, but does not affect the primary or master branch allowing you to work freely without disrupting the "live" version.

### Remote {-}
The connection of a local repository with one on GitHub. It permits revision history to be synchronized by publishing local commits and downloading any new changes from GitHub.

### Pull Request {-}
A  feature on GitHub which provides conversation, line-by-line code review, change history analysis, and summaries of modified files.

## Using GitHub [^1] {-}

### Step 1. Create a Repository {-}

A **repository** is usually used to organize a single project. Repositories can contain folders and files, images, videos, spreadsheets, and data sets â€“ anything your project needs. We recommend including a *README*, or a file with information about your project. GitHub makes it easy to add one at the same time you create your new repository. *It also offers other common options such as a license file*.

Your `hello-world` repository can be a place where you store ideas, resources, or even share and discuss things with others.

#### To create a new repository {-}

- In the upper right corner, next to your avatar or identicon, click "+" and then select New repository.  
- Name your repository `hello-world`.  
- Write a short description.  
- Select **Initialize this repository with a README**.

### Step 2. Clone Repository {-}

When you create a repository on GitHub, it exists as a *remote* repository. You can clone your repository to create a *local* copy on your computer and sync between the two locations.

#### To clone a repository {-}

- On GitHub, navigate to the main page of the repository.  
- Under your repository name, click **Clone or download**.

- Click **Clone**.

### Step 3. Commit a change in your project {-}

As you make changes to files in your project and save them locally, you will also see the changes in GitHub Desktop.

- The red icon indicates removed files.  
- The yellow icon indicates modified files.  
- The green icon indicates added files.  

![](https://help.github.com/assets/images/help/desktop/commit-some.png)

- Select the changes that you want reflected on your GitHub repository (usually all changes are commited).  
- At the bottom of the list of changes, in the Summary field, type a short, meaningful commit message.

- Under the Description field, click **Commit to master**.  
- Click **Push origin** to push your changes to the remote.

That's it! Your changes are now up on GitHub.
